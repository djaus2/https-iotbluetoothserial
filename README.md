IoT Core Generic Bluetooth Serial Universal Windows App


Project Description
 Universal Win App that runs on Windows 10, including IoT Core (eg Raspberry PI2) that connects to an embedded, eg Arduino, device over Bluetooth Serial.

 There are two projects: The Universal Windows App that requires Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2015 RTM. Requires a generic Bluetooth dongle. I use a very old CSR V1.1 version

The Arduino serial loopback Sketch. The Arduino device requires a Bluetooth adapter connected to pins 0 and 1 as the code uses the Serial class. I used a Sparkfun Sparkfun Bluetooth Mate Gold as in  Windows-10-IoT-Windows-Remote-Arduino-and-Universal-Windows-Platform



Note: This IS NOT a Windows Remote Arduino activity.
